# Spring did not invent the Web

[From a discussion on Spring](http://disq.us/p/1051xfy)
>I struggle a bit to understand how Spring is helpful.
> It just seems like every Spring example I see,
> creates complex xml files and unintuative annotations
> and the end result is something that's not that hard to do
> without the extra layer of complexity. For example,
> just creating a servlet, reading the request parameters,
> and sending a response is really simple.
> Using Spring to do this same thing seems a lot more complicated.
> I guess what I dislike the most is that the resulting Spring application
> (with all the xml and annotations) is completely confusing to
> read for someone who isn't familiar with all the details about how Spring works.
> For simple servlets, if you know Java, it's pretty easy to just
> read the code and understand what it's doing.
> I know Spring is very useful, I just wish simpler.
> It's supposed to make the like of developers easier...
> but does it really?
