# Why Not Spring?
[Spring](http://spring.io) has a reputation for being complex.  Complexity is not a desirable Software characteristic.  Your productivity varies inversely with complexity.

Code wants to be simple...

I struggle a bit to understand how Spring is helpful.  It just seems like every Spring example I see,
creates complex xml files and unintuative annotations
and the end result is something that's not that hard to do
without the extra layer of complexity.

## Noun Soup
~~~
As a side effect of its size, be prepared to spend joyous hours digging through piles of classes that while logically named, start to merge together into a gigantic pile of nouns when you're tired ("sure, you just connect your TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy to your UserCredentialsConnectionFactoryAdapter to your .. zzzzzzzz "). To be fair, they really are logically named, it's a reasonable response to the size of the framework, but still.

## Finding the right examples to follow
~~~
Dealing with some parts of spring can be frustrating when they're not well documented parts of the core and documentation you do find diverges across the multiple major versions.

## The Learning Curve
~~~
* Complex: One of the major criticisms faced by the Spring framework is that it is complex! No so clear focus, more than 2400 classes, 49 other tools and tons of the other things make it complicated for the developers.

* The biggest disadvantage of spring is it size, it tries to be all in one Java Development framework. It works fine when you do have architectural standards followed in your company for the usage of any frameworks ( ask why you need something like Spring? IOC, so did you see any other framework? What else you will get from Spring , whether youâ€™ll need it ? Etc.)

## Magic is hard
~~~
...
When I first started learning the Spring Framework I was completely lost every time something went wrong because I didn't know where things were going wrong. The reason I didn't know that was because I didn't fully understand all the things that the framework was managing for me and thus it all seemed like magic and magic is hard to debug.
...
All of the other pieces of Spring do similarly impressive things for you without you having to worry about them until something goes wrong.
